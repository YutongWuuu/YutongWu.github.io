									<h1>Qianhui: Hold Hands and Draw<br /></h1>
								</header>
								<h3>Part 1: Establishment</h3>
								<p>As a university startup project, my classmates and I founded a nonprofit company called "Qianhui Culture." The aim of Qianhui Culture is to support rural revitalization through art, using collaborative picture books to promote Mandarin and spread scientific and educational knowledge. "牵" means holding hands, leading rural children to the world of arts, "绘" means drawing, taking part into creative industry. I designed a visual system for the brand, with the element of heart, rainbow and dove.</p>

								<h3>Part 2:Collaborative Picture Books</h3>
								<p>As the Visual Director, I was primarily responsible for the production of these picture books. There are two picture books published: "the Story of an Apple" and "Teeth Beauty Context". We got inspiration from the paintings of Zhuanglang children and added educational content. The story of apples shows the production process of Zhuanglang’s specialty apples, and the teeth beauty contest popularizes dental health knowledge to children.</p>

								<h3>Part 3: Animated Picture Book</h3>
								<p> Considering the limited dissemination of paper picture books, I made an animated picture book "Stationery Family" and released it on TikTok.</p>

								<h3>Part 4: Practice Group</h3>
								<p> In July 2022, we brought our picture books to Zhuanglang County, where we conducted art education public welfare classes at local primary schools and read our created picture books with the children and their mothers. During this time, I served as the main instructor and taught a screen printing experience class to the children at the Zhuanglang County Cultural Center. In addition to the creative classes, I also participated in activities such as cultural relics mapping, rural survey, rural photography classes and photography exhibitions.</p>

								<h3>Part 5: Online Art Class</h3>
								<p> After returning from Zhuanglang, we recorded an art class video to enable the dissemination of beauty across geographical distances. The video was selected as one of the Top 32 in Alibaba's 'Hello Classmate' Chinese Rural Aesthetic Education Design Competition.</p>
