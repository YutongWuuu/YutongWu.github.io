								<p>Chinese Millennial Dreamcore artists often describe the architecture of the millennial era, which carries the childhood memories of China's post-2000 generation, as an old computer operating system. As a post-2000 generation, I have grown up not only within the walls of a physical house but also within the vast expanses of electronic space. A Windows XP computer was my childhood toy, spending my time on web chat, spicy girl avatars, cheap flashy effects, dressing up my virtual image, and Flash games. Over the years, I have witnessed numerous websites, unable to keep up with the rapid pace of technological advancement, fade into obscurity. This decline mirrors the fate of old houses destined for demolition, left feeling out of place in an ever-evolving digital landscape. These outdated websites are refered as "electronic waste," relics of a bygone era struggling to find relevance in a new, dynamic world.</p>
								<p>This intervention will transform abandoned digital spaces into compelling art installations in the form of video, raising awareness about the environmental and cultural impacts of digital waste and promoting sustainable digital practices. I chronicled the rapid development of technology in China, illustrating how technology has evolved from simplicity to complexity. In this process of becoming more complex and extensive, people no longer feel the same sense of belonging to the digital world as they once did. At the same time, excessive features cause people to lose their sense of choice and lead to a waste of computing resources. Like those abandoned houses in the city, they do not have residential value, but they can provide an interesting experience for urban explorers. I intend to encourage people to be the digital explorers, it is also about finding a valuable way for these abandoned bytes to exist.</p>
